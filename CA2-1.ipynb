    "“Today, big data is ubiquitous, machine learning applications are thriving, artificial intelligence appears in\n",
    "everyday conversations, and the internet of things is present even in household appliances. Businesses and\n",
    "organizations are increasingly managed through cloud computing and high performance computing is\n",

    "decision-support could revolutionize agriculture to a great extent . Food could be produced more efficiently,\n",
    "of higher nutritional quality, in more stable supplies, with less environmental damage, and likely with\n",

    "You have been tasked with analysing Ireland's Agricultural data and comparing the Irish Agri sector with\n",
    "other countries worldwide. This analysis should also include forecasting, sentiment analysis and evidence\n",
    "based recommendations for the sector as well as a complete rationale of the entire process used to\n",
    "discover your findings. Your Research could include export, import, trade imbalance, arable production,\n",
    "animal stock, medicinal input, organic, gm products etc. (or any other relevant topic EXCEPT Climate\n",

    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "- While topical, Agricultural impact on Climate Change SHOULD NOT be chosen as an area of research for this assessment.\n",
    "- Members of the European Union implement the Common Agricultural Policy and this should be researched as it has a significant statistical impact.\n",

[0-20]\n",

You must justify your choices and verify the applicability of the tests. Hypotheses and conclusions must be clearly stated. You are expected to use at least 5 different inferential statistics tests.

Machine Learning models can be used for Prediction, Classification, Clustering, sentiment analysis, recommendation systems and Time series analysis.

You can choose appropriate features from the datasets and a target feature to answer the question asked in the scenario in the case of supervised learning. [0 - 30]\n",

    "- You should train and test for Supervised Learning and other appropriate metrics for unsupervised/semi-supervised machine learning models that you have chosen. Use cross validation to provide authenticity of the modelling outcomes. You can apply dimensionality reduction methods to prepare the dataset based on your machine learning modelling requirements.

    "- Exploratory Data Analysis helps to identify patterns, inconsistencies, anomalies, missing data, and other attributes and issues in data sets so problems can be addressed. Evaluate your raw data and detail, in depth, the various attributes and issues that you find. Your evaluation should reference evidence to support your chosen methodology and use visualizations to illustrate your findings. [0-\n",

    "- Taking into consideration the tasks required in the machine learning section, use appropriate data cleaning, engineering, extraction and/or other techniques to structure and enrich your data. Rationalize your decisions and implementation, including evidence of how your process has addressed the problems identified in the EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) stage and how your structured data will assist in the analysis stage. This should include visualizations to illustrate your work and evidence to support your methodology.[0-30]\n",
    "- Modern farming has a great dependence on technology and relies upon visualizations to communicate information, this includes web based, mobile based and many other digital transmission formats. Develop an interactive dashboard tailored to modern farmers, using tufts principles, to showcase the information/evidence gathered following your Machine Learning Analysis. Detail the rationale for approach and visualisation choices made during development.
