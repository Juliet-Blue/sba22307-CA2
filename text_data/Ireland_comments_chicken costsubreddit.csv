3,iwb0bda,t3_yus6a0,"No, that chicken fillet roll may not push you over the edge, but everything has increased. So you may not notice it, but someone who lives close to the breadline or even was already below the poverty line will now see this pinch on everything they already couldn't afford. 

People keep saying to shop cheaper, cut down on spending, and be smart with fuel/electricity, but there's already a percentage of Ireland who have been doing that before this crisis. How can they cut down? I'm not saying that this is the only source of burglaries, but when people get squeezed so much that they can't see light at the end of the tunnel, some go down that path.",t3_yus6a0

5,iwb8cmu,t3_yus6a0,"It certainly has an impact. Inflation and higher costs of living put increased financial pressure on everyone, and that increased pressure will inevitably cause a few folks to resort to criminal activity who might not otherwise have done so, and cause some who already engage in that sort of activity to do it more frequently or try for larger scores. Mary from Athlone probably isn't going to go rob the Maxol because her electric bill is higher, sure, but John from Rathkeale might be finding that the odd ""borrowing"" of tools and scrap from the neighbour's unlocked shed isn't covering the bills anymore and might decide to resort to something a bit riskier but more lucrative as a result.",t3_yus6a0
6,iwbep2k,t3_yus6a0,"Nope they are right. I have worked in several stores since Corona and it has become very clear that the inflation crises was causing a big increase in shoplifting.

Your analysis is shallow. It's not about a chicken fillet roll going up. If inflation is 10% and people therefore have roughly 10% less money then some people are more likely to steal to make up the difference because they can't handle a quality of life drop (especially since quality of life was piss poor to begin with )",t3_yus6a0

But more specifically, what we are talking about is a direct increase in burglaries in general, as what's being claimed, due to cost of living. And so If someone is making a claim that such acts are on the increase due to the cost of living increase, it's up to them to prove that it's happening.

22,iozdutt,t3_xhrv7m,"OP given you do some of your shop in Dunnes here is a neat trick to get 33% off your grocery bill.

1. Dowload the Dunnes app and using a temporary email address sign up. Note do not use your phone number for the verification process, you need to get the code from the inbox of your temporary email address
2. Enter the code and complete sign up. New customers of the app get a 10 euro off 30 euro voucher within about 20 minutes of signing up
3. Repeat this process as much as you can till the idiots in head office one day cop it and close off the loophole that allows customers of Dunnes to get 33% off. Ensure you only spend slightly over 30 euro each time so you are getting the max potential discount. This way you are getting 30 euros worth of food for 20 euro. Match that with their meat sales when they have 25% off and you are saving a nice wad of money. 

Other than that it sounds like you are doing everything you can. In general when it comes to trying to reduce costs look at things like your car insurance or other larger bills like phone, broadband, tv. There is always a way to reduce them and it will save you a lot more money than cutting back on food would.

If you have done all that and are still really stuck check out on app caled Olio. Tesco give them lots of food that is near its use by date and it is then distributed in local communities, use the app to find out who local to you is distributing or organising pick ups.",t3_xhrv7m

AFAIK Kerrygold claims the cows used to make their milk are fed 89% grass, which is a huge amount. Irish beef and dairy isnt too bad on the environment, as the cars are mainly grass fed. 

Most Irish Dairy produce is sold to Co-ops, so the farmers tend to get a decent price for their produce. Unfortunately most meet is sold to a handful of beef processors, who only care about their bottomline. Dairy was generally seen as more profitable than beef for a while. 

Chicken production isnt great in Ireland. A handful of producers on the border of NI/ROI run chicken farms. The welfare of pigs isnt much better. Only really cows are well looked after in Ireland.
