3,Cheap and Easy Meal Plans to ease costs,24,xhrv7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/xhrv7m/cheap_and_easy_meal_plans_to_ease_costs/,18,2022-09-18 20:57:31,"I dont think its just me right now, but i certainly am starting to feel the pinch of rising costs. Every week im looking at trying to cut costs where I can. I rent in Dublin with my partner in a houseshare, saving for a mortgage. Im thankful that my rent isnt utterly extortionate at the moment but that may change we will see what my landlord gets up to in the next couple of months. 

I've done a couple of little changes that in my circumstances are feasible, such as stop buying coffee in work, hopping off the luas a couple of stops early for the lower fare and walking the rest of the way to work. The luas thing sounds utterly desperate i know, but it saves me about 20 quid a month but im getting more exercise in which im happy about. 

I also started using my revolut as a way to save a little more by using the vaults for my spare change which has been really handy getting some unexpected items but were needed badly. 

The food bill is the next think I looked at. And trying to cut down on that bill but not cut down nutrition wise either. What i have done is made meals plans and stick to them for breakfast lunch and dinner each week. I try keep it within a certain budget too. It doesnt always but i do tend to stick to it when i can. 

Mods im hoping this is allowed, i know there is a subreddit for cheap and healthy meals but it is definitely more American based and i figured it might help basing it with Irish prices. I want to share a meal plan and the cost of it to show people you can still eat well without spending a tonne of money on the food bill. I have included the total price in each calculation, obviously I have a lot left over such as porridge or frozen vegetables for example that I wouldn't totally use up that week. 

This is based for 2 people, 1 in the office 3 days a week 2 days at home, 1 in the office on shift work 4 days a week. I did my weekly shop between Dunnes and Lidl last week. Im fortunate that i have the option of both as well as other shops to pick from such as Aldi and Tesco if I need them. 

Breakfast: Porridge made with milk and a spoonful of jam and a banana.  (€4 between us, porridge not included as i got a 1.5kg bag free on my lidl plus app) 

Lunch: Ham, cheese and lettuce sandwich with homemade potato and leek soup (€8 between us)

Snacks: Apple, Orange, Plum (€1.50 between us depends on whats on offer)

Dinners for the week: 

Sunday: Roast chicken thighs, frozen veg, baby potatoes (€4.50)

Monday: Left over chicken and vegetables cooked with condensed cream of mushroom soup served with rice (€3.35, chicken and vegetables included in Sundays price)

Tuesday:  Green and Red Dahl made with chopped tomatoes, vegetables and coconut milk served with rice (€4.50, spices not included as already had cumin, chilli, garlic, ginger and turmeric to hand, cost of rice included in Monday's recipe)

Wednesday: Pasta with green pesto and cheese (€2.50, cost of cheese included in lunch price) 

Thursday: Left over from Tuesday's Dahl

Friday: Fish Finger and veggie pie topped with a mustard cheesy mash (€2.60, price of cheese included in lunch, mustard was already to hand but afaik the jar cost me 59cent in lidl)

Saturday is usually a takeout to treat ourselves. 

In total this shop came to €31 between the two of us and I still have frozen veg, porridge, rice, jam lentils left over for another week.  We did have to pop out and get more bread by the end of the week as the one we had started to turn, but that is to be expected. Sometimes i might have a money off voucher for Dunnes or Lidl will have something i need on offer in their app or something for free like that porridge, that helps me save a lot as well. 

I try change it up week to week and it goes by what's on offer. We have cut back on meat a good bit lately but if we are buying meat we make sure the meat we get we can stretch out like chicken thighs, pork lion or mince. 

Just thought this might give some people an idea of cutting back on the food bill and still make really nice food. Im more than happy to share some of my cheap and cheerful meals if anyone wants them. If anyone has any of their own I'd love to hear them."

6,Will you do more grocery shopping in the north once minimum unit alcohol pricing is introduced?,1,rsx04s,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/rsx04s/will_you_do_more_grocery_shopping_in_the_north/,24,2021-12-31 16:03:30,"Lots of items are already much cheaper in the north. For example, here's a comparison of [prices in Newry and Dublin](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=United+Kingdom&city1=Newry&country2=Ireland&city2=Dublin&displayCurrency=EUR).

Overall, grocery prices are 20% cheaper in Newry, but the difference in prices for some items is much greater, e.g.

 - cheese (35% cheaper in Newry)
 - fags (30% cheaper in Newry)
 - chicken fillets (71% cheaper in Newry)
 - wine (84% cheaper in Newry)
 - domestic beer (90% cheaper in Newry)
 - spuds (35% cheaper in Newry)

Obviously the difference in alcohol prices will be even greater in a week's time. Newry is only a little over an hour's drive from Dublin at off-peak times. Presumably most people living close to the border are already doing most of their shopping in the north, why wouldn't you?"

9,Trusting the system,0,i9asdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/i9asdn/trusting_the_system/,8,2020-08-13 23:25:24,"How do you go about trusting a system again when it has cost you so much? 

I had an idea that the mental health system here was bad, not really understanding how bad it was, but I knew it was bad. Well the chickens came home to roost in these last few weeks, a family member fell through the cracks of the mental health system here, I can't sit here and fully blame the system, we as a family failed as well. This person from what we've learned had been off their meds for 2 months previous and we didn't notice things out of sorts. 

The day after we lost, we found out that the pharmacy knew they weren't collecting their meds and the doctor also knew they weren't taking them, we don't know if their was a push from the ""support team"" to get them back taking them, what went on there, I'm hoping from inquest this all comes out. The biggest question I have is why if those avenues were walked and they failed that we as family members were not spoken with, I whole heartedly believe what has happened would not have happened if we were notified that they were off their meds and weren't looking to get back on them, if we had the chance to speak with them, I/we would not be going through this absolute heart ache. I don't get it!! 

The pharmacy told us that they viewed them as a capable person??? I don't get this, how do you view a person off their meds for that length of time as being a capable person... I don't understand this.. 

My head is spinning, and these questions are months from being officially answered. If it's the last thing I do, I'll fight to improve this for every other family who may walk this path. A PERSON OFF THEIR MEDS SHOULD LOSE THEIR RIGHT TO PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY, yeah they can hold this while they take their meds that they need, when they come off them, they should be viewed as kinda like a ""child"", 1 week/2 weeks/3 weeks things need to be ramped up to get the support network in behind people to stop them from tipping over. Strangers, although qualified, they are not family."

Wouldn't even bother asking for a spice bag.

Edit: Attempted ordering a half and half to be informed that it was only served with chicken curry. Which is essentially a 4 in 1. Back to the drawing board. 

I ordered chips, rice and curry sauce separately and just threw them all together on a plate. But it doesn't feel the same without the aluminium tray. Plus it costs an added 2-3 pounds all together."
