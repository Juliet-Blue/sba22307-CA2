Christmas time, is one that is mainly fuelled by pints and supported by a few tactical chicken fillet rolls (or wraps, for all the weirdos). This Christmas, I was particularly reliant on the golden fillets life source, as my family was quite sick and I had to fend for myself (ah me heart, jaysus. Light a candle 🙏), when I had the sudden realisation that I was forking out FIVE EURO each time. It feels like I'm a crab that's been slowly cooked in warm water. I may sound like a frugal, mean old bastard but is there a justification for such a hike in price? God help you wanna throw the odd flat white in, to really spoil yourself and shell out a tenner for.the privilege. Has anyone else experienced this or am I just experiencing the Dublin living tax?"

TL;DR - Ireland good. 


So after 9 days all over your beautiful island with my wife and 3 kids, here are my thoughts....

1) The ""Irish people are SO nice"" convention is a trope. It's the same the world round - I met a ton of great people, and also had run ins with some fucking twats. In fairness, the twats were of many nationalities/cultures.

2) Smithwicks > Guinness

3) Tractor Runs are the most redneck thing I've ever fucking seen. These same hillbilly eejits that were complaining on diesel prices were then riding full size tractors down the road for 45km on an N-road, whole family in the cab, blaring their horns fucking up traffic for 2+ hours in rural Co. Galway. 

4) Tayto > King

5) Driving on the left in right-hand drive was not nearly as big of an issue as I feared. Also, roundabouts are fucking great.

6) Barry's > Lyons

7) Dublin is fantastic for its cultural and historical attractions, and not much else. It's like any other major European city - it's too diverse to have a real solid identity. GREAT food, though.

8) The drive into Cobh, seeing the cathedral and harbor, was amazing.

9) The Cliffs of Moher are the most beautiful natural place I've ever seen. Also, if you go, don't forget to look south. The scene from the viewpoint towards Shingaunagh and the inlet is just as breathtaking.

10) Irish chefs are masters of making local fresh ingredients shine. Great food.

11) A spice bag after 8-10 pints is amazing. 

12) Chicken Fillet Burgers are ok, but nothing special. 

13) Visiting the city and street where my Great Great Grandfather grew up (my direct immigrant progenitor), where his father and mother are buried at the same church he was baptized in, was a significantly more emotional experience than I imagined it would be. As Americans, we don't really have a historical identity of our own, and we tend to borrow heavily from our ancestry. Having learned about him, the oppression he experienced and what he went through to leave Kilkenny and come to Boston alone as a teenager......walking the same street was surreal.

14) Why do all of your teenage boys have Peaky Blinder haircuts?

15) Your national museums (esp Archaeology) are fantastic, but don't let your kids see the bog bodies if they enjoy sleep.

16) Finally, I love that RTE has a kids channel that sometimes has cartoons in Gaeilge to support language development. That said, fucking hell Spongebob in Irish just isn't right."
2,Now €20 for a kebab - Zaytoon,278,ywhon1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/ywhon1/now_20_for_a_kebab_zaytoon/,117,2022-11-16 02:55:04,"I know there have been threads previously, but I'd like it to get full attention.

Got charged 20e a couple of weeks ago in Zaytoon for a regular sized kebab meal.

Been a customer for a decade or two, that was my last visit. I didn't realise what I'd been charged until I sat down, and wish I had voted with my feet immediately.

That's insane gouging imo, if people will pay it, fair enough. I won't be again.

I wanted to add a pic but not sure if I can.

As per my revolut, the previous prices for the same meal (chicken shish meal):

€14.40 Jan - 2022
€13.50 July - 2021

The loyalty card was discontinued at some point over the last year or so - again, fair enough.

For me, to add insult, my friend got the same order that I did, but he got a coke zero, I got a coke. His was €19.

250ml tins
The sugar tax is 30c per litre, which isas 7.5 cent.
Yea fuck it, throwing another quid on, sugar tax tax at 13x.

Fuck all that."
3,Is anybody elses local chinese take away on the verge of offering finance options?,34,yjko7f,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/yjko7f/is_anybody_elses_local_chinese_take_away_on_the/,64,2022-11-01 20:40:43,"For what seems like forever, chinese was the option that was somewhat on par with chipper for prices and way below an Indian.

Times have changed; and it appears that our chinese friends have really embraced this inflationary period.

* €3.90 for rice

* €3.50 for chips

* €11.70 for a chicken curry

* €3.40 for prawn crackers

* €4.50 for delivery

Yeah well, fuck that. Bollocks to paying for what is probably going to be half portioned cold reheated food in a soggy plastic bag, while paying a stupid amount on delivery for the pleasure. 

Had a look around other Chinese in the area and they're all the same.  

Am i just fucked in my area or have they all cartelled (triaded) with the pricing?, I almost feel ripped off and i havent even ordered anything.

Anyway, Bombay Aloo on the way."

6,Cheap and Easy Meal Plans to ease costs,24,xhrv7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/xhrv7m/cheap_and_easy_meal_plans_to_ease_costs/,18,2022-09-18 20:57:31,"I dont think its just me right now, but i certainly am starting to feel the pinch of rising costs. Every week im looking at trying to cut costs where I can. I rent in Dublin with my partner in a houseshare, saving for a mortgage. Im thankful that my rent isnt utterly extortionate at the moment but that may change we will see what my landlord gets up to in the next couple of months. 

I've done a couple of little changes that in my circumstances are feasible, such as stop buying coffee in work, hopping off the luas a couple of stops early for the lower fare and walking the rest of the way to work. The luas thing sounds utterly desperate i know, but it saves me about 20 quid a month but im getting more exercise in which im happy about. 

I also started using my revolut as a way to save a little more by using the vaults for my spare change which has been really handy getting some unexpected items but were needed badly. 

The food bill is the next think I looked at. And trying to cut down on that bill but not cut down nutrition wise either. What i have done is made meals plans and stick to them for breakfast lunch and dinner each week. I try keep it within a certain budget too. It doesnt always but i do tend to stick to it when i can. 

Mods im hoping this is allowed, i know there is a subreddit for cheap and healthy meals but it is definitely more American based and i figured it might help basing it with Irish prices. I want to share a meal plan and the cost of it to show people you can still eat well without spending a tonne of money on the food bill. I have included the total price in each calculation, obviously I have a lot left over such as porridge or frozen vegetables for example that I wouldn't totally use up that week. 

This is based for 2 people, 1 in the office 3 days a week 2 days at home, 1 in the office on shift work 4 days a week. I did my weekly shop between Dunnes and Lidl last week. Im fortunate that i have the option of both as well as other shops to pick from such as Aldi and Tesco if I need them. 

Breakfast: Porridge made with milk and a spoonful of jam and a banana.  (€4 between us, porridge not included as i got a 1.5kg bag free on my lidl plus app) 

Lunch: Ham, cheese and lettuce sandwich with homemade potato and leek soup (€8 between us)

Snacks: Apple, Orange, Plum (€1.50 between us depends on whats on offer)

Dinners for the week: 

Sunday: Roast chicken thighs, frozen veg, baby potatoes (€4.50)

Monday: Left over chicken and vegetables cooked with condensed cream of mushroom soup served with rice (€3.35, chicken and vegetables included in Sundays price)

Tuesday:  Green and Red Dahl made with chopped tomatoes, vegetables and coconut milk served with rice (€4.50, spices not included as already had cumin, chilli, garlic, ginger and turmeric to hand, cost of rice included in Monday's recipe)

Wednesday: Pasta with green pesto and cheese (€2.50, cost of cheese included in lunch price) 

Thursday: Left over from Tuesday's Dahl

Friday: Fish Finger and veggie pie topped with a mustard cheesy mash (€2.60, price of cheese included in lunch, mustard was already to hand but afaik the jar cost me 59cent in lidl)

Saturday is usually a takeout to treat ourselves. 

In total this shop came to €31 between the two of us and I still have frozen veg, porridge, rice, jam lentils left over for another week.  We did have to pop out and get more bread by the end of the week as the one we had started to turn, but that is to be expected. Sometimes i might have a money off voucher for Dunnes or Lidl will have something i need on offer in their app or something for free like that porridge, that helps me save a lot as well. 

I try change it up week to week and it goes by what's on offer. We have cut back on meat a good bit lately but if we are buying meat we make sure the meat we get we can stretch out like chicken thighs, pork lion or mince. 

Just thought this might give some people an idea of cutting back on the food bill and still make really nice food. Im more than happy to share some of my cheap and cheerful meals if anyone wants them. If anyone has any of their own I'd love to hear them."

10,List of ways to save serious money on food,607,tz1f3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/tz1f3j/list_of_ways_to_save_serious_money_on_food/,349,2022-04-08 11:30:06,"Growing up in a ""thrifty"" household and then spending years as an even more broke student I'd like to share some of the lesser-known money saving measures I developed. It's amazing how easy it is to spend huge money on food and most of the stuff I see here tends to be related to things like driving and heating so I'd like to pitch in some other ideas. Just a heads up that I don't live in Ireland anymore so I'm going from experience. Here ya go:

* Eat more foods that require little to no cooking - my favourite is hummus with some whole-grain crackers, homemade salads with some dressing, sandwiches, brown bread with butter
* Get chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts - a fraction of the price and far better in my opinion
* At least 2 days per week where you don't eat meat
* If you have an electric oven, get an airfryer instead - uses much less energy and cooks food quicker
* Pasta bakes and potato bakes are super cheap - I used to make huge ones with 5+ portions for less than 3 euros in ingredients that tasted great, Aldi used to have big jars of sauce for a euro think they still do, a can of tuna, some onions, tomatoes
* Use the same coffee grounds twice or more in your cafetiere - leave it for longer each time and you'll barely notice the difference
* Bacon offcuts - tough to spot in the cooler but you used to get a kilo of serious bacon for 2 euro, don't know about now
* Vegetables are generally far cheaper than meat, doesn't mean you need to cut out meat completely but bulk out your dishes, fried eggplant with parmesan is great, leeks, some potato in your curry
* French toast is class
* Cheesy toasties are also class
* Just f\*cking drink less
* Don't let ingredients go off in the fridge, make them into something and freeze them.
* Avoid buying ingredients for specific dishes, buy ones that you can use across multiple dishes
* Meal prep - make a big f\*ckload of pasta sauce, divide it into sandwich bags and freeze it
* If you can get your hands on some MSG it makes food a lot more delicious for pennies
* Sometimes it's **not** cheaper to make it yourself, especially if it's just for one or two people. Things like lasagna you're better off just buying one of the big 1kg pre-made ones that are 2 or 3 euros
* If you like your soft drinks then just go to the pound shop and get a crate of them, just maintain your discipline. Bring one with you for lunch and keep a few in the car. Saves 50%+ each time.
* Better and healthier than soft drinks just get some cheap cordial

That's it for now I'll edit as more come to me - feel free to add your own!

Edit: I am lazy and my standards are low, I grew up poor and even poorer than that in college. If you're easily offended by the idea of using coffee grounds twice or not eating meat with every meal then I suggest you take the time to thank the heavens for your socio-economic privilege."
11,The most disappointed I’ve been since restrictions lifted,1801,sri6lk,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/sri6lk/the_most_disappointed_ive_been_since_restrictions/,132,2022-02-13 13:03:19,"Yesterday I had an amazing time. Was like the pandemic hadn’t happened. I got two really nice German Weiss beer pints, a load of delicious Mexican food for 30€, I got to the movies, saw a film with my mate in a semi inebriated state, laughed my bollocks off and then stopped off for a nightcap before turning in at 1am for a solid 8 hours of peaceful sleep.

And then it was today. I had a little hangover, nothing too bad but definitely enough to justify a treat. So instead of the usual porridge or scrambled egg, I said feck it and decided to get one of the posh chicken fillet rolls from
Supervalu. 

Yes I know they’re over priced (about 6.50) but only 1.50 of that is an overcharge. They are solid quality.

So I ask the deli lad for a chicken fillet roll, he says what toppings, I say the usual, lettuce, cheese, Mayo and just a tiny bit of sweet chili sauce.

I’ve got a ten minute drive home so I figure I’ll ask him to stick it in the toaster over for a minute, make sure it’s warm when I get home.

I drive home, make a hearty mug of tea and settle down in front of the telly, I take one bite of the roll and my heart sinks. I take another bite and it gets worse.

What I have is a roll with lettuce, cheese, Mayo and sweet chili sauce.

What kind of horrific accident of a human has the mental capacity to make a chicken fillet roll without a chicken fillet?!!! 

I can picture him now, holding a sliced chicken fillet, MY sliced chicken fillet behind his back and laughing; knowing in his mind that i’m far away and my Sunday is ruined.

I hope you’re all having a better Sunday than me."
12,Will you do more grocery shopping in the north once minimum unit alcohol pricing is introduced?,1,rsx04s,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/rsx04s/will_you_do_more_grocery_shopping_in_the_north/,24,2021-12-31 16:03:30,"Lots of items are already much cheaper in the north. For example, here's a comparison of [prices in Newry and Dublin](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=United+Kingdom&city1=Newry&country2=Ireland&city2=Dublin&displayCurrency=EUR).

Overall, grocery prices are 20% cheaper in Newry, but the difference in prices for some items is much greater, e.g.

 - cheese (35% cheaper in Newry)
 - fags (30% cheaper in Newry)
 - chicken fillets (71% cheaper in Newry)
 - wine (84% cheaper in Newry)
 - domestic beer (90% cheaper in Newry)
 - spuds (35% cheaper in Newry)

Obviously the difference in alcohol prices will be even greater in a week's time. Newry is only a little over an hour's drive from Dublin at off-peak times. Presumably most people living close to the border are already doing most of their shopping in the north, why wouldn't you?"
13,Is Irish beef considered good in Ireland?,0,nxg988,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/nxg988/is_irish_beef_considered_good_in_ireland/,45,2021-06-11 13:41:24,"I've been thinking about this for several years now. In my country we got our own domestic beef on sale in ordinary grocery store alongside Irish beef which is usually about half the price of the domestic ones.

Unsurprisingly the domestic stuff is widely considered better because of less antibiotics and stuff, along with the fact that people like supporting local production.

Anyway. In Ireland, is the domestic beef considered the ""better alternative""? Are there even imported stuff that's cheaper?

In short, how's the beef situation over there?

(While we're at it, is the situation regarding pork and chicken the same?)

Edit: fixed the misconception about the antibiotics line. The general consensus over here seem to be that Irish beef producers use more antibiotics than domestic. I got no numbers for Ireland, but that's still what the general population believe.

Edit: I also want to be clear that I mean ""fresh"" beef. Not frozen. However, chicken is often sold frozen here so if you have anything to add about chicken in Ireland, please take this into consideration.

Last edit: while I don't care much for downvotes I apparently need to clarify that I am not out to vilify the Irish meat industry or anything. Keep your national pride or whatever. I only made this post to get to know more about the whole situation, there are some apparent cultural differences here that I didn't know about before and I am grateful for anyone who spent their time to give their view on it.

Off the top of my head, I think a freddo is still around 50c but it's only a matter of time before that breaches the dreaded euro mark.

Bar cheap own brand biscuits, what can you actually buy in a shop for a euro? When I was a lad, a mars bar or snickers were about 80c and a can of coke was around the same or up to 95c - €1.

My (21F) partner (22M) doesn't know how to cook a balanced meal and lives on takeaway and frozen chicken nuggets and chips. When he cleans things they're always still visibly dirty afterwards. He didn't even know we owned a mop for months after we'd moved in together. An appliance in our home is broken and I asked him to call someone to have it fixed. It has been a year. It hasn't been fixed. He doesn't notice that things are dirty. He'll turn on a half empty dishwasher without glancing around the kitchen first to see if anything needs to be put in. He doesn't know how to shop and just buys the first thing he sees regardless of suitability or price (usually ends up being the most expensive version of the item) or just 'couldn't find' the thing you asked him to get. If we run out of kitchen roll or something, he just tells me about it. I have to make all the shopping lists, fix things around the house, clean the place, etc., 
I've never come home to a dinner cooked or the place clean though I always offer to make extra food for him (he turns it down as I put vegetables in my meals).

I tried at first to teach him these things but frankly I'm not his ma, we're both full time students plus I work 4-5 days a week on top of it, so I just don't have the time or energy any more. If I ask him again at this point to try and learn these things himself it'll just be me nagging.

So I'm wondering is there a home ec course I can enrol him in? Preferably in Dublin city centre or nearby. Maybe if I e-mail one of those repeat leaving cert places they'll let him enrol just for the home ec class? I'm dead serious about this. My budget is 500 euro.
