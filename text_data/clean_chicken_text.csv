3,"Cheap and Easy Meal Plans to ease costs: I dont think its just me right now, but i certainly am starting to feel the pinch of rising costs. Every week im looking at trying to cut costs where I can. I rent in Dublin with my partner in a houseshare, saving for a mortgage. Im thankful that my rent isnt utterly extortionate at the moment but that may change we will see what my landlord gets up to in the next couple of months. 

I've done a couple of little changes that in my circumstances are feasible, such as stop buying coffee in work, hopping off the luas a couple of stops early for the lower fare and walking the rest of the way to work. The luas thing sounds utterly desperate i know, but it saves me about 20 quid a month but im getting more exercise in which im happy about. 

I also started using my revolut as a way to save a little more by using the vaults for my spare change which has been really handy getting some unexpected items but were needed badly. 

The food bill is the next think I looked at. And trying to cut down on that bill but not cut down nutrition wise either. What i have done is made meals plans and stick to them for breakfast lunch and dinner each week. I try keep it within a certain budget too. It doesnt always but i do tend to stick to it when i can. 

Mods im hoping this is allowed, i know there is a subreddit for cheap and healthy meals but it is definitely more American based and i figured it might help basing it with Irish prices. I want to share a meal plan and the cost of it to show people you can still eat well without spending a tonne of money on the food bill. I have included the total price in each calculation, obviously I have a lot left over such as porridge or frozen vegetables for example that I wouldn't totally use up that week. 

This is based for 2 people, 1 in the office 3 days a week 2 days at home, 1 in the office on shift work 4 days a week. I did my weekly shop between Dunnes and Lidl last week. Im fortunate that i have the option of both as well as other shops to pick from such as Aldi and Tesco if I need them. 

Breakfast: Porridge made with milk and a spoonful of jam and a banana.  (€4 between us, porridge not included as i got a 1.5kg bag free on my lidl plus app) 

Lunch: Ham, cheese and lettuce sandwich with homemade potato and leek soup (€8 between us)

Snacks: Apple, Orange, Plum (€1.50 between us depends on whats on offer)

Dinners for the week: 

Sunday: Roast chicken thighs, frozen veg, baby potatoes (€4.50)

Monday: Left over chicken and vegetables cooked with condensed cream of mushroom soup served with rice (€3.35, chicken and vegetables included in Sundays price)

Tuesday:  Green and Red Dahl made with chopped tomatoes, vegetables and coconut milk served with rice (€4.50, spices not included as already had cumin, chilli, garlic, ginger and turmeric to hand, cost of rice included in Monday's recipe)

Wednesday: Pasta with green pesto and cheese (€2.50, cost of cheese included in lunch price) 

Thursday: Left over from Tuesday's Dahl

Friday: Fish Finger and veggie pie topped with a mustard cheesy mash (€2.60, price of cheese included in lunch, mustard was already to hand but afaik the jar cost me 59cent in lidl)

Saturday is usually a takeout to treat ourselves. 

In total this shop came to €31 between the two of us and I still have frozen veg, porridge, rice, jam lentils left over for another week.  We did have to pop out and get more bread by the end of the week as the one we had started to turn, but that is to be expected. Sometimes i might have a money off voucher for Dunnes or Lidl will have something i need on offer in their app or something for free like that porridge, that helps me save a lot as well. 

I try change it up week to week and it goes by what's on offer. We have cut back on meat a good bit lately but if we are buying meat we make sure the meat we get we can stretch out like chicken thighs, pork lion or mince. 

Just thought this might give some people an idea of cutting back on the food bill and still make really nice food.

6,"Will you do more grocery shopping in the north once minimum unit alcohol pricing is introduced?: Lots of items are already much cheaper in the north. For example, here's a comparison of [prices in Newry and Dublin](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=United+Kingdom&city1=Newry&country2=Ireland&city2=Dublin&displayCurrency=EUR).

Overall, grocery prices are 20% cheaper in Newry, but the difference in prices for some items is much greater, e.g.

 - cheese (35% cheaper in Newry)
 - fags (30% cheaper in Newry)
 - chicken fillets (71% cheaper in Newry)
 - wine (84% cheaper in Newry)
 - domestic beer (90% cheaper in Newry)
 - spuds (35% cheaper in Newry)

Obviously the difference in alcohol prices will be even greater in a week's time. Newry is only a little over an hour's drive from Dublin at off-peak times.

9,"Trusting the system: How do you go about trusting a system again when it has cost you so much? 

I had an idea that the mental health system here was bad, not really understanding how bad it was, but I knew it was bad. Well the chickens came home to roost in these last few weeks, a family member fell through the cracks of the mental health system here, I can't sit here and fully blame the system, we as a family failed as well. This person from what we've learned had been off their meds for 2 months previous and we didn't notice things out of sorts. 

The day after we lost, we found out that the pharmacy knew they weren't collecting their meds and the doctor also knew they weren't taking them, we don't know if their was a push from the ""support team"" to get them back taking them, what went on there, I'm hoping from inquest this all comes out. The biggest question I have is why if those avenues were walked and they failed that we as family members were not spoken with, I whole heartedly believe what has happened would not have happened if we were notified that they were off their meds and weren't looking to get back on them, if we had the chance to speak with them, I/we would not be going through this absolute heart ache. I don't get it!! 

The pharmacy told us that they viewed them as a capable person??? I don't get this, how do you view a person off their meds for that length of time as being a capable person... I don't understand this.. 

My head is spinning, and these questions are months from being officially answered. If it's the last thing I do, I'll fight to improve this for every other family who may walk this path. A PERSON OFF THEIR MEDS SHOULD LOSE THEIR RIGHT TO PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY, yeah they can hold this while they take their meds that they need, when they come off them, they should be viewed as kinda like a ""child"", 1 week/2 weeks/3 weeks things need to be ramped up to get the support network in behind people to stop them from tipping over.

17,"Before/After from a Yank, Part 2: The ""before"" can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/yv8tuq/beforeafter_from_a_yank/).

TL;DR - Ireland good. 


So after 9 days all over your beautiful island with my wife and 3 kids, here are my thoughts....

1) The ""Irish people are SO nice"" convention is a trope. It's the same the world round - I met a ton of great people, and also had run ins with some fucking twats. In fairness, the twats were of many nationalities/cultures.

2) Smithwicks > Guinness

3) Tractor Runs are the most redneck thing I've ever fucking seen. These same hillbilly eejits that were complaining on diesel prices were then riding full size tractors down the road for 45km on an N-road, whole family in the cab, blaring their horns fucking up traffic for 2+ hours in rural Co. Galway. 

4) Tayto > King

5) Driving on the left in right-hand drive was not nearly as big of an issue as I feared. Also, roundabouts are fucking great.

6) Barry's > Lyons

7) Dublin is fantastic for its cultural and historical attractions, and not much else. It's like any other major European city - it's too diverse to have a real solid identity. GREAT food, though.

8) The drive into Cobh, seeing the cathedral and harbor, was amazing.

9) The Cliffs of Moher are the most beautiful natural place I've ever seen. Also, if you go, don't forget to look south. The scene from the viewpoint towards Shingaunagh and the inlet is just as breathtaking.

10) Irish chefs are masters of making local fresh ingredients shine. Great food.

11) A spice bag after 8-10 pints is amazing. 

12) Chicken Fillet Burgers are ok, but nothing special. 

13) Visiting the city and street where my Great Great Grandfather grew up (my direct immigrant progenitor), where his father and mother are buried at the same church he was baptized in, was a significantly more emotional experience than I imagined it would be. As Americans, we don't really have a historical identity of our own, and we tend to borrow heavily from our ancestry. Having learned about him, the oppression he experienced and what he went through to leave Kilkenny and come to Boston alone as a teenager......walking the same street was surreal.

14) Why do all of your teenage boys have Peaky Blinder haircuts?

18,"Now €20 for a kebab - Zaytoon: I know there have been threads previously, but I'd like it to get full attention.

Got charged 20e a couple of weeks ago in Zaytoon for a regular sized kebab meal.

Been a customer for a decade or two, that was my last visit. I didn't realise what I'd been charged until I sat down, and wish I had voted with my feet immediately.

That's insane gouging imo, if people will pay it, fair enough. I won't be again.

I wanted to add a pic but not sure if I can.

As per my revolut, the previous prices for the same meal (chicken shish meal):

€14.40 Jan - 2022
€13.50 July - 2021

The loyalty card was discontinued at some point over the last year or so - again, fair enough.

For me, to add insult, my friend got the same order that I did, but he got a coke zero, I got a coke. His was €19.

250ml tins
The sugar tax is 30c per litre, which isas 7.5 cent.

22,"Cheap and Easy Meal Plans to ease costs: I dont think its just me right now, but i certainly am starting to feel the pinch of rising costs. Every week im looking at trying to cut costs where I can. I rent in Dublin with my partner in a houseshare, saving for a mortgage. Im thankful that my rent isnt utterly extortionate at the moment but that may change we will see what my landlord gets up to in the next couple of months. 

I've done a couple of little changes that in my circumstances are feasible, such as stop buying coffee in work, hopping off the luas a couple of stops early for the lower fare and walking the rest of the way to work. The luas thing sounds utterly desperate i know, but it saves me about 20 quid a month but im getting more exercise in which im happy about. 

I also started using my revolut as a way to save a little more by using the vaults for my spare change which has been really handy getting some unexpected items but were needed badly. 

The food bill is the next think I looked at. And trying to cut down on that bill but not cut down nutrition wise either. What i have done is made meals plans and stick to them for breakfast lunch and dinner each week. I try keep it within a certain budget too. It doesnt always but i do tend to stick to it when i can. 

Mods im hoping this is allowed, i know there is a subreddit for cheap and healthy meals but it is definitely more American based and i figured it might help basing it with Irish prices. I want to share a meal plan and the cost of it to show people you can still eat well without spending a tonne of money on the food bill. I have included the total price in each calculation, obviously I have a lot left over such as porridge or frozen vegetables for example that I wouldn't totally use up that week. 

This is based for 2 people, 1 in the office 3 days a week 2 days at home, 1 in the office on shift work 4 days a week. I did my weekly shop between Dunnes and Lidl last week. Im fortunate that i have the option of both as well as other shops to pick from such as Aldi and Tesco if I need them. 

Breakfast: Porridge made with milk and a spoonful of jam and a banana.  (€4 between us, porridge not included as i got a 1.5kg bag free on my lidl plus app) 

Lunch: Ham, cheese and lettuce sandwich with homemade potato and leek soup (€8 between us)

Snacks: Apple, Orange, Plum (€1.50 between us depends on whats on offer)

Dinners for the week: 

Sunday: Roast chicken thighs, frozen veg, baby potatoes (€4.50)

Monday: Left over chicken and vegetables cooked with condensed cream of mushroom soup served with rice (€3.35, chicken and vegetables included in Sundays price)

Tuesday:  Green and Red Dahl made with chopped tomatoes, vegetables and coconut milk served with rice (€4.50, spices not included as already had cumin, chilli, garlic, ginger and turmeric to hand, cost of rice included in Monday's recipe)

Wednesday: Pasta with green pesto and cheese (€2.50, cost of cheese included in lunch price) 

Thursday: Left over from Tuesday's Dahl

Friday: Fish Finger and veggie pie topped with a mustard cheesy mash (€2.60, price of cheese included in lunch, mustard was already to hand but afaik the jar cost me 59cent in lidl)

Saturday is usually a takeout to treat ourselves. 

In total this shop came to €31 between the two of us and I still have frozen veg, porridge, rice, jam lentils left over for another week.  We did have to pop out and get more bread by the end of the week as the one we had started to turn, but that is to be expected. Sometimes i might have a money off voucher for Dunnes or Lidl will have something i need on offer in their app or something for free like that porridge, that helps me save a lot as well. 

I try change it up week to week and it goes by what's on offer. We have cut back on meat a good bit lately but if we are buying meat we make sure the meat we get we can stretch out like chicken thighs, pork lion or mince. 

Just thought this might give some people an idea of cutting back on the food bill and still make really nice food.

26,"List of ways to save serious money on food: Growing up in a ""thrifty"" household and then spending years as an even more broke student I'd like to share some of the lesser-known money saving measures I developed. It's amazing how easy it is to spend huge money on food and most of the stuff I see here tends to be related to things like driving and heating so I'd like to pitch in some other ideas. Just a heads up that I don't live in Ireland anymore so I'm going from experience. Here ya go:

* Eat more foods that require little to no cooking - my favourite is hummus with some whole-grain crackers, homemade salads with some dressing, sandwiches, brown bread with butter
* Get chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts - a fraction of the price and far better in my opinion
* At least 2 days per week where you don't eat meat
* If you have an electric oven, get an airfryer instead - uses much less energy and cooks food quicker
* Pasta bakes and potato bakes are super cheap - I used to make huge ones with 5+ portions for less than 3 euros in ingredients that tasted great, Aldi used to have big jars of sauce for a euro think they still do, a can of tuna, some onions, tomatoes
* Use the same coffee grounds twice or more in your cafetiere - leave it for longer each time and you'll barely notice the difference
* Bacon offcuts - tough to spot in the cooler but you used to get a kilo of serious bacon for 2 euro, don't know about now
* Vegetables are generally far cheaper than meat, doesn't mean you need to cut out meat completely but bulk out your dishes, fried eggplant with parmesan is great, leeks, some potato in your curry
* French toast is class
* Cheesy toasties are also class
* Just f\*cking drink less
* Don't let ingredients go off in the fridge, make them into something and freeze them.
* Avoid buying ingredients for specific dishes, buy ones that you can use across multiple dishes
* Meal prep - make a big f\*ckload of pasta sauce, divide it into sandwich bags and freeze it
* If you can get your hands on some MSG it makes food a lot more delicious for pennies
* Sometimes it's **not** cheaper to make it yourself, especially if it's just for one or two people. Things like lasagna you're better off just buying one of the big 1kg pre-made ones that are 2 or 3 euros
* If you like your soft drinks then just go to the pound shop and get a crate of them, just maintain your discipline. Bring one with you for lunch and keep a few in the car. Saves 50%+ each time.
* Better and healthier than soft drinks just get some cheap cordial

That's it for now I'll edit as more come to me - feel free to add your own!

27,"The most disappointed I’ve been since restrictions lifted: Yesterday I had an amazing time. Was like the pandemic hadn’t happened. I got two really nice German Weiss beer pints, a load of delicious Mexican food for 30€, I got to the movies, saw a film with my mate in a semi inebriated state, laughed my bollocks off and then stopped off for a nightcap before turning in at 1am for a solid 8 hours of peaceful sleep.

And then it was today. I had a little hangover, nothing too bad but definitely enough to justify a treat. So instead of the usual porridge or scrambled egg, I said feck it and decided to get one of the posh chicken fillet rolls from
Supervalu. 

Yes I know they’re over priced (about 6.50) but only 1.50 of that is an overcharge. They are solid quality.

So I ask the deli lad for a chicken fillet roll, he says what toppings, I say the usual, lettuce, cheese, Mayo and just a tiny bit of sweet chili sauce.

I’ve got a ten minute drive home so I figure I’ll ask him to stick it in the toaster over for a minute, make sure it’s warm when I get home.

I drive home, make a hearty mug of tea and settle down in front of the telly, I take one bite of the roll and my heart sinks. I take another bite and it gets worse.

What I have is a roll with lettuce, cheese, Mayo and sweet chili sauce.

What kind of horrific accident of a human has the mental capacity to make a chicken fillet roll without a chicken fillet?!!!

28,"Will you do more grocery shopping in the north once minimum unit alcohol pricing is introduced?: Lots of items are already much cheaper in the north. For example, here's a comparison of [prices in Newry and Dublin](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=United+Kingdom&city1=Newry&country2=Ireland&city2=Dublin&displayCurrency=EUR).

Overall, grocery prices are 20% cheaper in Newry, but the difference in prices for some items is much greater, e.g.

 - cheese (35% cheaper in Newry)
 - fags (30% cheaper in Newry)
 - chicken fillets (71% cheaper in Newry)
 - wine (84% cheaper in Newry)
 - domestic beer (90% cheaper in Newry)
 - spuds (35% cheaper in Newry)

Obviously the difference in alcohol prices will be even greater in a week's time. Newry is only a little over an hour's drive from Dublin at off-peak times.

29,"Is Irish beef considered good in Ireland?: I've been thinking about this for several years now. In my country we got our own domestic beef on sale in ordinary grocery store alongside Irish beef which is usually about half the price of the domestic ones.

Unsurprisingly the domestic stuff is widely considered better because of less antibiotics and stuff, along with the fact that people like supporting local production.

Anyway. In Ireland, is the domestic beef considered the ""better alternative""? Are there even imported stuff that's cheaper?

In short, how's the beef situation over there?

(While we're at it, is the situation regarding pork and chicken the same?)

Edit: fixed the misconception about the antibiotics line. The general consensus over here seem to be that Irish beef producers use more antibiotics than domestic. I got no numbers for Ireland, but that's still what the general population believe.

Edit: I also want to be clear that I mean ""fresh"" beef. Not frozen. However, chicken is often sold frozen here so if you have anything to add about chicken in Ireland, please take this into consideration.

Last edit: while I don't care much for downvotes I apparently need to clarify that I am not out to vilify the Irish meat industry or anything. Keep your national pride or whatever. I only made this post to get to know more about the whole situation, there are some apparent cultural differences here that I didn't know about before and I am grateful for anyone who spent their time to give their view on it.

33,"Home economics classes for adults?: Does such a thing exist?

My (21F) partner (22M) doesn't know how to cook a balanced meal and lives on takeaway and frozen chicken nuggets and chips. When he cleans things they're always still visibly dirty afterwards. He didn't even know we owned a mop for months after we'd moved in together. An appliance in our home is broken and I asked him to call someone to have it fixed. It has been a year. It hasn't been fixed. He doesn't notice that things are dirty. He'll turn on a half empty dishwasher without glancing around the kitchen first to see if anything needs to be put in. He doesn't know how to shop and just buys the first thing he sees regardless of suitability or price (usually ends up being the most expensive version of the item) or just 'couldn't find' the thing you asked him to get. If we run out of kitchen roll or something, he just tells me about it. I have to make all the shopping lists, fix things around the house, clean the place, etc., 
I've never come home to a dinner cooked or the place clean though I always offer to make extra food for him (he turns it down as I put vegetables in my meals).

I tried at first to teach him these things but frankly I'm not his ma, we're both full time students plus I work 4-5 days a week on top of it, so I just don't have the time or energy any more. If I ask him again at this point to try and learn these things himself it'll just be me nagging.

So I'm wondering is there a home ec course I can enrol him in? Preferably in Dublin city centre or nearby. Maybe if I e-mail one of those repeat leaving cert places they'll let him enrol just for the home ec class? I'm dead serious about this. My budget is 500 euro.

58,"OP given you do some of your shop in Dunnes here is a neat trick to get 33% off your grocery bill.

1. Dowload the Dunnes app and using a temporary email address sign up. Note do not use your phone number for the verification process, you need to get the code from the inbox of your temporary email address
2. Enter the code and complete sign up. New customers of the app get a 10 euro off 30 euro voucher within about 20 minutes of signing up
3. Repeat this process as much as you can till the idiots in head office one day cop it and close off the loophole that allows customers of Dunnes to get 33% off. Ensure you only spend slightly over 30 euro each time so you are getting the max potential discount. This way you are getting 30 euros worth of food for 20 euro. Match that with their meat sales when they have 25% off and you are saving a nice wad of money. 

Other than that it sounds like you are doing everything you can. In general when it comes to trying to reduce costs look at things like your car insurance or other larger bills like phone, broadband, tv. There is always a way to reduce them and it will save you a lot more money than cutting back on food would.

If you have done all that and are still really stuck check out on app caled Olio.

123,"Like most farms in the EU. Irish farms are quite small. I think they are on around 33 hectares, although they are still bigger than the EU most EU farms (69% of EU farms are 5 hectares or less). 

Most Irish farmers are really passionate about their farms and their animals welfare. I know plenty of farmers who spent far more time with their farm animals than their children. Irish farms tend to be owned and run by the same man. Unless it is a massive farm, there is usually no help on the farm

AFAIK Kerrygold claims the cows used to make their milk are fed 89% grass, which is a huge amount. Irish beef and dairy isnt too bad on the environment, as the cars are mainly grass fed. 

Most Irish Dairy produce is sold to Co-ops, so the farmers tend to get a decent price for their produce. Unfortunately most meet is sold to a handful of beef processors, who only care about their bottomline. Dairy was generally seen as more profitable than beef for a while. 

Chicken production isnt great in Ireland. A handful of producers on the border of NI/ROI run chicken farms. The welfare of pigs isnt much better. Only really cows are well looked after in Ireland.

129,"I've all but given up on takeaway, bar the very rare time when I'm knackered after a really long day or whatnot. It just became an absolute farce, so I looked into how to make it yourself and to be honest, it's shown me that the standard of takeaway in Ireland really isn't great.

Those €4.50 chips you can buy for about 50c or less in a bag of spuds. It turns out for a good quality fast food type burger all you need to do is get two 60g lump of high fat (18%) mince, flatten them into circles, lightly toast the outside of the buns under the grill, and add toppings (lettuce/tomato/mushroom/bacon for me), then add two easy singles for the last minute or so of cooking - I usually hate them but they're perfect for a burger.

Chinese and Indian are insanely cheap to make, with the caveat that you'll need to stock the shelves with herbs and spices (Aldi, Lidl and Tesco own brand make this way, way cheaper than it used to be though. I made enough to have beef korma, chicken madras, saag paneer, onion bhajis, pilau rice and naan break on every plate and prices it to about €3 per person. What cost just shy of €20 would have been far, far in excess of €100 in we ordered out. Fried rice is marked up even more again - a homemade serving costs maybe €0.50c.

Pizzas are the same - you can make them for around €1 yourself or spend 20x that getting one delivered.

205,"I wasn't being snarky or having a 'gotcha' moment. I read exactly what you wrote, and I was pointing out (apparently the wrong way) that MSG is not needed when using your own ingredients. I dine on the cheap. I make do with what I have, and still wouldn't use that muck.

FWIW, MSG shouldn't cause a 'burning sensation' - if it is, you check out whether or not you have any reaction to it. It is literally just a flavour enhancer. Nothing else. If you want a proper 'burning sensation' sprinkle some cayenne pepper, or even chilli on your food.

As for the couple of euro price difference, I should have clarified. I live in an area where takeaways are expensive, and was surprised to see yours even more expensive in the midlands. I can see how you thought I was belittling the expense in your area, but I was doing the opposite.  I was shocked by the price, as I am in my own area, which I already know to be expensive. So both are pricey, yours are just pricey AF.

259,"I'll be honest, I've never found an actually good kebab in this country.

Zaytoon is about as good as a near-bottom tier (not food poisoning or tourist trap, but largely avoided by locals) Berlin kebab shop for like 4-5x the price. 

Better than chipper kebabs, but not what I'd call ""good"", having seen what a kebab can be when done properly.

What really baffles me is that in this country we have far superior chicken, lamb and veal (the three main meats used in kebab) compared to Germany, where the meat quality kind of sucks, but our kebab shops are absolutely rubbish.

Somehow the places here use absolutely crap bread that tastes like cardboard, somehow really greasy meat, exceptionally poor quality salads that don't taste fresh at all, and the sauces aren't great either. 

If you took our high quality ingredients and combined them with the skill and attention to detail of the Turkish-German kebab shops, you would have a genuinely premium product that I'd happily spend a tenner on (that's about 3x what I would pay in Germany usually - 3 to 4 euros for a döner with everything).

263,"Turkish-German kebabs as found in Germany, and Turkish kebabs as found in Turkey, are somewhat different for a start. 

You will find a fair amount of kebab shops in Berlin that offer up Zaytoon ""quality"" of kebab for 3 to 4 euro, but those tend to be avoided entirely by anyone local with a clue - there are (for the same price) much better places, probably twice as good - really fresh salad, really good bread, etc.

The quality of the lamb (or chicken, or veal) matters, as does how well/properly the meat is marinated/spiced before putting on a skewer. 

Then there's some care needed with regards the temperature, so the fats render out (removing greasiness) but also the meat doesn't become dry shite.

The salads and sauces: can be either good or shit, tbh. Salads either fresh, or it can fuck off. 

The bread: underappreciated aspect of a good kebab. You know when you have a kebab with good bread. You also know when you have one with shit bread.

Sometimes you have to be careful how you order something like that. Many places have a deal, often only listed as a meal under ""sweet & sour chicken balls"" in the main menu area, i.e. it comes with chips. In all takeaways whenever I asked to change the sauce they would.  


If you do not get it as a deal they might charge full individual prices. E.g. in mine if you rattle it off ""can I get chicken balls, curry sauce and chips, and a spice bag with that"" if somebody said ""can I get a portion of chicken balls, and chips, a spice bag, oh and a curry sauce"" It is 2.70 more, unless the cashier is sound, the portion sizes are identical. In some places it may be automated menus doing the count.  


It used to work out at just 10 or 20cent to get curry sauce, nowadays its crazier, it is 8.70 for chicken balls and chips, but if you get the curry sauce too it is 8.50!  


A mate of mine refused to believe this, he rang an order to a different place as ""3 portions of chicken balls, (the person must have said anything else?), 3 portions of chips, (pause again) and 3 curry sauces.

1. Dowload the Dunnes app and using a temporary email address sign up. Note do not use your phone number for the verification process, you need to get the code from the inbox of your temporary email address
2. Enter the code and complete sign up. New customers of the app get a 10 euro off 30 euro voucher within about 20 minutes of signing up
3. Repeat this process as much as you can till the idiots in head office one day cop it and close off the loophole that allows customers of Dunnes to get 33% off. Ensure you only spend slightly over 30 euro each time so you are getting the max potential discount. This way you are getting 30 euros worth of food for 20 euro. Match that with their meat sales when they have 25% off and you are saving a nice wad of money. 

Other than that it sounds like you are doing everything you can. In general when it comes to trying to reduce costs look at things like your car insurance or other larger bills like phone, broadband, tv. There is always a way to reduce them and it will save you a lot more money than cutting back on food would.

I moved to buying the coconut rice milk in lidl - €1.69 which served me better living on my own as milk goes off in my house. I bought a few herb pots and they've serving me well. Baking your own bread is still cheaper at the moment - yeast in Aldi is 79c and Tescos own is 99c - 8 packets each, 1 need for 500g of flour. I get the fresh yeast from the Polish shop once in a while which lasts for about 2 kg of flour. Costs 49c (red-white packaging). I also get some of their flours. Taking into consideration the cost for electricity, 2kg flour, seeds and nuts and yeast, I get away with about €3 for a loaf of bread that lasts a week, no mold like some of the store-bought breads.

Offers go into the freezer, leftover go into the freezer. If I get an offer on flour, I make pizza dough and stock the freezer. Very little fresh fruit bar bananas and apples or anything on offer.

418,"There are two ways I'd suggest and both of them would mean you will be fairly bored by the food but are cheap. You can get ready meal shakes, there are a few different brands and they are cheaper than regular food, you will be mega bored though after a while. Buy a rice cooker and get big bag of rice from the asian market, 1 cup = 1 meal if you get some sauce and some veg with some meat. So for 1 person 2 days of food 3 meals a day is 6 cups of rice and you can cook it all at once with most decent rice makers. In terms of rice makers don't get any of the western ones, the Asian ones are the best, Cuckoo is the brand, they cost about 80 euro and are super simple to use. Just put in rice (wash the rice a few times) with about half a fingertip of water above your rice and press the button on the front. Easy peasy.

* pressure cooker - it's just cheaper and faster to cook with when you need to boil the spuds or veg.

426,"My oven is 3kW.  It's not going to use that constantly, but it's the only number I've got so I'm going to go with it.  I'll do the same thing to the air fryer to try to keep the fight fair. My last leccy bill says I'm paying 21.12 cents per kWh, so that oven costs 63.36 cents to run per hour.

A quick peek at amazon, and I'm going to generalize an air fryer to 100 quid and 1500W.  Because I'm lazy and it's going to make my maths easier - comparing 1.5kW to 3kW is nice and easy, it costs half as much per hour to run.  So 31.68 cents per hour.

So in a straight race - saving 31.68 cents per hour, it'd take 315.65 hours to pay for itself. At 1 hour a day it'd pay for itself in less than 11 months.

That doesn't account for it being faster.  I have no idea how much faster.  If it's twice as fast, then 1 hour of oven is 30 minutes of air fryer, so 63.36 cents of oven time is worth 15.68 cents of air fryer time, so you're down to 210 hours (of comparable oven time) to pay it back.  So 7 months if we stick to an hour a day.

(To make these realistic you'd need to figure out the duty cycle of each.  I mean my oven doesn't run full bore, it turns itself on and off to maintain the temperature.

431,"Depends, really.

Electric (multi-cook) pressure cookers are fantastic, but have their pros and cons.

They're great for one-pot stuff (like a chicken stew) but, if you're making several things in different ways, you'll find yourself using the hobs and the oven instead or as well.

Like, I use mine several times a week, but still make bolognese the old-fashioned way.

But I always use it for potatoes, because it's handy.

You can fry stuff in it just fine, but it's really no handier than the hob.

That said, I *will* brown off the beef in it, if I'm making a beef stew, just to keep the browned juices in it.

And don't believe the stuff about ""a chicken stew in 10 minutes"".

It's more like ""a chicken stew after 5 minutes of prep, 10 minutes of pressure build-up, and then 10 minutes of cook time, and then possibly 10 minutes of natural pressure release"".

Which is still great, with zero need to look after it after you press start, but there's no need to omit that.

Anyway, here's some simple recipes I like which friends and family loved:

433,"I'm not a fan of plant-based milks, overall. Lactose-free cows milk is the best.

Also, I'm intolerant to soy milk :/

Whilst I can make my own bread, I don't have the time during the week to do it. It takes the better part of a day to make a loaf, as I do it all by hand - no fancy bread making machine. It also requires a certain amount of warmth to be available right when I need it, so this isn't a good time of year for that.

I'll probably make bread some weekends once warmer weather is guaranteed. 

The thing is, a bag of flour still costs about  €4 per kg.. and that only does 2 loaves. I'd have to buy a new bag every week, because it gets used for things like gravy during the week as well.

480,"It's a bit complicated in the US, because there's no nationwide sales tax. Here, the VAT amount is the same everywhere for any given class of product or service, and it doesn't change very often. In the US, sales tax (the equivalent of VAT for the end consumer) is largely determined at the state level, but counties and even cities can add their own sales taxes as well, so the same item might be taxed at, say, 5% statewide, but 6% in one particular county in the state, and 7% in one particular city in that county. Those rates can also change relatively frequently; tacking on a small (usually ~1%) sales tax from time to time is a common way for municipalities or counties to quickly add some funding to their budget for a particular year. For retailers and other businesses with a presence in multiple cities, counties, or states, having to factor tax into their listed prices would become rather complex, and would make uniform pricing policies and standards difficult to implement.",it s a bit complicated in the us because there s no nationwide sales tax here the vat amount is the same everywhere for any given class of product or service and it doesn t change very often in the us sales tax the equivalent of vat for the end consumer is largely determined at the state level but counties and even cities can add their own sales taxes as well so the same item might be taxed at say 5 statewide but 6 in one particular county in the state and 7 in one particular city in that county those rates can also change relatively frequently tacking on a small usually 1 sales tax from time to time is a common way for municipalities or counties to quickly add some funding to their budget for a particular year for retailers and other businesses with a presence in multiple cities counties or states having to factor tax into their listed prices would become rather complex and would make uniform pricing policies and standards difficult to implement ,bite complicate us nationwide sales tax vat amount everywhere give class product service change often us sales tax equivalent vat end consumer largely determine state level counties even cities add sales tax well item might tax say 5 statewide 6 one particular county state 7 one particular city county rat also change relatively frequently tack small usually 1 sales tax time time common way municipalities counties quickly add fund budget particular year retailers businesses presence multiple cities counties state factor tax list price would become rather complex would make uniform price policies standards difficult implement
