Zaytoon is about as good as a near-bottom tier (not food poisoning or tourist trap, but largely avoided by locals) Berlin kebab shop for like 4-5x the price. 

Better than chipper kebabs, but not what I'd call ""good"", having seen what a kebab can be when done properly.

What really baffles me is that in this country we have far superior chicken, lamb and veal (the three main meats used in kebab) compared to Germany, where the meat quality kind of sucks, but our kebab shops are absolutely rubbish.

Somehow the places here use absolutely crap bread that tastes like cardboard, somehow really greasy meat, exceptionally poor quality salads that don't taste fresh at all, and the sauces aren't great either. 

If you took our high quality ingredients and combined them with the skill and attention to detail of the Turkish-German kebab shops, you would have a genuinely premium product that I'd happily spend a tenner on (that's about 3x what I would pay in Germany usually - 3 to 4 euros for a döner with everything).

47,iwlxjk3,t1_iwlq53s,"Turkish-German kebabs as found in Germany, and Turkish kebabs as found in Turkey, are somewhat different for a start. 

You will find a fair amount of kebab shops in Berlin that offer up Zaytoon ""quality"" of kebab for 3 to 4 euro, but those tend to be avoided entirely by anyone local with a clue - there are (for the same price) much better places, probably twice as good - really fresh salad, really good bread, etc.

The quality of the lamb (or chicken, or veal) matters, as does how well/properly the meat is marinated/spiced before putting on a skewer. 

Then there's some care needed with regards the temperature, so the fats render out (removing greasiness) but also the meat doesn't become dry shite.

The salads and sauces: can be either good or shit, tbh. Salads either fresh, or it can fuck off. 

The bread: underappreciated aspect of a good kebab. You know when you have a kebab with good bread. You also know when you have one with shit bread. 

Its not ""gourmet cuisine"", but it can be done amazingly well (where it's actually *good*, or it can be done poorly (where you need six pints to even consider it).",t3_ywhon1

Sometimes you have to be careful how you order something like that. Many places have a deal, often only listed as a meal under ""sweet & sour chicken balls"" in the main menu area, i.e. it comes with chips. In all takeaways whenever I asked to change the sauce they would.  


If you do not get it as a deal they might charge full individual prices. E.g. in mine if you rattle it off ""can I get chicken balls, curry sauce and chips, and a spice bag with that"" if somebody said ""can I get a portion of chicken balls, and chips, a spice bag, oh and a curry sauce"" It is 2.70 more, unless the cashier is sound, the portion sizes are identical. In some places it may be automated menus doing the count.  


It used to work out at just 10 or 20cent to get curry sauce, nowadays its crazier, it is 8.70 for chicken balls and chips, but if you get the curry sauce too it is 8.50!  


A mate of mine refused to believe this, he rang an order to a different place as ""3 portions of chicken balls, (the person must have said anything else?), 3 portions of chips, (pause again) and 3 curry sauces.

2. Enter the code and complete sign up. New customers of the app get a 10 euro off 30 euro voucher within about 20 minutes of signing up
3. Repeat this process as much as you can till the idiots in head office one day cop it and close off the loophole that allows customers of Dunnes to get 33% off.

Other than that it sounds like you are doing everything you can. In general when it comes to trying to reduce costs look at things like your car insurance or other larger bills like phone, broadband, tv. There is always a way to reduce them and it will save you a lot more money than cutting back on food would.

Taking into consideration the cost for electricity, 2kg flour, seeds and nuts and yeast, I get away with about €3 for a loaf of bread that lasts a week, no mold like some of the store-bought breads.

Offers go into the freezer, leftover go into the freezer. If I get an offer on flour, I make pizza dough and stock the freezer. Very little fresh fruit bar bananas and apples or anything on offer.

You can get ready meal shakes, there are a few different brands and they are cheaper than regular food, you will be mega bored though after a while. Buy a rice cooker and get big bag of rice from the asian market, 1 cup = 1 meal if you get some sauce and some veg with some meat. So for 1 person 2 days of food 3 meals a day is 6 cups of rice and you can cook it all at once with most decent rice makers. In terms of rice makers don't get any of the western ones, the Asian ones are the best, Cuckoo is the brand, they cost about 80 euro and are super simple to use. Just put in rice (wash the rice a few times) with about half a fingertip of water above your rice and press the button on the front. Easy peasy.

Same with Mince, skip the more expensive 5% fancy stuff, the 8-10% fat actually cooks better in the slow cooker, and stewing beef is cheaper than expensive cuts too.

Cook in bulk too, I get a few days out of a meal prepped in the slow cooker, just pop remaining stews or currys into a container and once cooled you can store in the fridge for 2-3 days. Also the slow cooker is the most energy efficient way to cook so get using one.",t3_tz1f3j

* Small contained oven (microwave size) saved us lots in our first rental as the oven in the house was a total money drain.
* Rice cooker - saves boiling extra water, much more efficient and also easier to cook with.
* slow cooker is a fantastic way to make stews and soups and make tough meat tender while saving money. If you have a night rate electricity you can also put it on overnight - N.B. it's not dangerous but always have a smoke alarm.
* pressure cooker - it's just cheaper and faster to cook with when you need to boil the spuds or veg.

In addition to the air-fryer already mentioned there are egg boilers and an endless supply of other gadgets. You can't have room for them all and they cost money to buy but whatever you use regularly will definitely be worth it.

210,i3w7ube,t1_i3w454c,"My oven is 3kW.  It's not going to use that constantly, but it's the only number I've got so I'm going to go with it.  I'll do the same thing to the air fryer to try to keep the fight fair. My last leccy bill says I'm paying 21.12 cents per kWh, so that oven costs 63.36 cents to run per hour.

A quick peek at amazon, and I'm going to generalize an air fryer to 100 quid and 1500W.  Because I'm lazy and it's going to make my maths easier - comparing 1.5kW to 3kW is nice and easy, it costs half as much per hour to run.  So 31.68 cents per hour.

So in a straight race - saving 31.68 cents per hour, it'd take 315.65 hours to pay for itself. At 1 hour a day it'd pay for itself in less than 11 months.

That doesn't account for it being faster.  I have no idea how much faster.  If it's twice as fast, then 1 hour of oven is 30 minutes of air fryer, so 63.36 cents of oven time is worth 15.68 cents of air fryer time, so you're down to 210 hours (of comparable oven time) to pay it back.  So 7 months if we stick to an hour a day.

(To make these realistic you'd need to figure out the duty cycle of each.  I mean my oven doesn't run full bore, it turns itself on and off to maintain the temperature.  So if you figure on it actually powering half the time and idling down half the time, 50% duty cycle would half the power cost / double the time to payback)",t3_tz1f3j

Electric (multi-cook) pressure cookers are fantastic, but have their pros and cons.

They're great for one-pot stuff (like a chicken stew) but, if you're making several things in different ways, you'll find yourself using the hobs and the oven instead or as well.

Like, I use mine several times a week, but still make bolognese the old-fashioned way.

But I always use it for potatoes, because it's handy.

You can fry stuff in it just fine, but it's really no handier than the hob.

That said, I *will* brown off the beef in it, if I'm making a beef stew, just to keep the browned juices in it.

And don't believe the stuff about ""a chicken stew in 10 minutes"".

It's more like ""a chicken stew after 5 minutes of prep, 10 minutes of pressure build-up, and then 10 minutes of cook time, and then possibly 10 minutes of natural pressure release"".

Which is still great, with zero need to look after it after you press start, but there's no need to omit that.

Whilst I can make my own bread, I don't have the time during the week to do it. It takes the better part of a day to make a loaf, as I do it all by hand - no fancy bread making machine.

I'll probably make bread some weekends once warmer weather is guaranteed. 

The thing is, a bag of flour still costs about  €4 per kg.. and that only does 2 loaves. I'd have to buy a new bag every week, because it gets used for things like gravy during the week as well.

247,h1eqq16,t3_nxg988,"I'm very surprised that Irish beef is cheaper than domestic beef in your country, is this something you have seen across the board or is there possibly one brand of cheap 'Irish beef' that is skewing your perception?

Irish beef and dairy is widely considered among, if not the, best in the world. It's not some mass produced cheap stuff that gets shipped all over the world because its cheap to produce, its exactly the opposite, its generally free range, grass fed and often organic. Beef farms here are generally small scale, family owned and not industrial.

Definitely something funky going on in your supermarket.

As for pork and chicken, I don't believe we have the same reputation for quality but we do have pretty good regulations on the animal welfare as far as I am aware. Chicken more than anything might be occasionally imported but many people would specially look for free range Irish chicken.",t3_nxg988
248,h1emmlm,t3_nxg988,"Bizarre... in Belgium, Irish beef is much more expensive than the Belgian stuff.

Also, their beef is gross. It's pink. Like no ageing to it. It makes sense, since their animals are mostly indoors. 

Our beef is of an incredible quality and incredibly cheap price. A testament to which is how funny would it look to see grass fed as a distinguisher here? Like, pretty much all our cows eat is grass. Meanwhile, in most of the rest of the world, grass fed is a symbol of distinct quality. It's funny, except for all the suffering and stuff. Like, I get the whole vegetarian side to it all, but just from a quality of life aspect, Irish cows have it made. Our island is a shade of green most cattle in the world will never ever see the likes of. Like, bar some French or Swiss herds in particular regions, there's not a country in the world with such a nice  level of fresh grass to herd ratio.",t3_nxg988

The cheap Irish ground beef in a way fill a niche where its considerably cheaper than domestic ground beef. 

It should be noted that several out of the most commonly cooked dishes here is made with ground beef or a blend of beef and pork, so ground meat is something that's always in high demand.",t3_nxg988

The meat industry is not nearly as big as the Irish or Danish ones and mostly ever serve domestic buyers. Never hear of anyone ever buying anything Swedish other than krisp rolls in a grocery store in other countries.

But boy do we eat meat. According to a newspaper article from two years ago we eat about 85kg of meat per person and year, apparently far above EU average. 29% of that being beef. To my knowledge the majority try to buy domestic wherever possible, most doing it out of principle.

All that being said, about half of all meat consumed here is imported. Don't know if it's because of consumer prices, low supply, or simply that some products people buy are only produced with imported meats.

Don't know the ratio of domestic vs imported of fresh meat, sadly.",t3_nxg988

As others have noted, menu prices here include VAT (our version of sales tax), and tipping is optional and 10% would be considered a good tip here. 

At a decent but not fancy sit-down restaurant here, you'd probably expect to pay €5-10 for a starter and for a dessert, and €10-20 for a main course. Something a bit more expensive like a steak might run you €20-€30. €4-6 or so for a pint, ~€6-8 for a glass of house wine, €10 for a mixed drink wouldn't be atypical for a restaurant.

264,fwuivc4,t1_fwu0pie,"It's a bit complicated in the US, because there's no nationwide sales tax. Here, the VAT amount is the same everywhere for any given class of product or service, and it doesn't change very often. In the US, sales tax (the equivalent of VAT for the end consumer) is largely determined at the state level, but counties and even cities can add their own sales taxes as well, so the same item might be taxed at, say, 5% statewide, but 6% in one particular county in the state, and 7% in one particular city in that county. Those rates can also change relatively frequently; tacking on a small (usually ~1%) sales tax from time to time is a common way for municipalities or counties to quickly add some funding to their budget for a particular year. For retailers and other businesses with a presence in multiple cities, counties, or states, having to factor tax into their listed prices would become rather complex, and would make uniform pricing policies and standards difficult to implement.",t3_hkoztb
