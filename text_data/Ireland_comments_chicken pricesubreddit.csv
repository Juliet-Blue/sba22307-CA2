1,j39pxca,t3_1059ggf,"We used to treat ourselves to a takeaway once a week (single parent, nice to get a night off cooking!) Those days are gone. Not only are the prices through the roof, the portions are smaller and the quality has taken a turn for the worse.

3,j3baofv,t3_1059ggf,"Reposting this again, We all like to think local businesses are ripping us off. And look that might be the case. But most takeaways are struggling themselves and the last thing they want to do is raise prices.

Like every business right now power prices are through the roof, my local chippers' monthly power bill went from €3.5k to just under €8k. Go ask the owner of your local chipper/takeaway/Chinese/pub etc what they are paying now compared to a year, year and a half ago.  
  
On top of that prices for many items have gone up too. A tray of fresh cod fish €75 not long ago is now €150. Beef patties and even potatoes themselves have gone up in price.",t3_1059ggf
4,j3bn3lf,t3_1059ggf,"I've all but given up on takeaway, bar the very rare time when I'm knackered after a really long day or whatnot. It just became an absolute farce, so I looked into how to make it yourself and to be honest, it's shown me that the standard of takeaway in Ireland really isn't great.

Those €4.50 chips you can buy for about 50c or less in a bag of spuds. It turns out for a good quality fast food type burger all you need to do is get two 60g lump of high fat (18%) mince, flatten them into circles, lightly toast the outside of the buns under the grill, and add toppings (lettuce/tomato/mushroom/bacon for me), then add two easy singles for the last minute or so of cooking - I usually hate them but they're perfect for a burger.

Chinese and Indian are insanely cheap to make, with the caveat that you'll need to stock the shelves with herbs and spices (Aldi, Lidl and Tesco own brand make this way, way cheaper than it used to be though. I made enough to have beef korma, chicken madras, saag paneer, onion bhajis, pilau rice and naan break on every plate and prices it to about €3 per person. What cost just shy of €20 would have been far, far in excess of €100 in we ordered out. Fried rice is marked up even more again - a homemade serving costs maybe €0.50c.

Pizzas are the same - you can make them for around €1 yourself or spend 20x that getting one delivered.

On and on the list goes.

Definitely hitting the point where doing a fake-away or something like that is now a fraction of the cost.

What really starts to hurt is when you put it in a separate revolut vault and can see the amount you’re spending per month on takeaways. We recently did it and can see our monthly spend on takeaways, once a week, had crept to just over 100e per month.

And people that use them don’t deserve to be labelled lazy either. In an ideal world, we’d cook everything fresh ourselves but that’s not realistic for everyone - particularly if it’s physically difficult for you to cook.

And yes, prices are sky high but you can’t expect their prices to stay the same when everything needed to run a takeaway business has increased - the comments here saying how cheap it was years ago are irrelevant really as nothing is the same price it was years ago.",t3_1059ggf

I looked at my bank account the next day and it was £10.50

Thought they overcharged me so I went and looked at their menu online and sure enough, the price was correct.

I looked through more images on their Instagram and Facebook and couldn't find their old menu with older prices. It looks like they went back and deleted them all.

I remembered there was an old takeaway menu in the drawer from ages ago and the same meal was £6.50 when I checked it.

To add insult to injury, the chicken burger used to be a fillet, now it's a processed/compressed chicken burger.

I tried to give them the benefit of doubt as everything is more expensive but £4 is a fuckin insane. Not to mention they upgraded to a bigger premises during COVID.

FWIW, MSG shouldn't cause a 'burning sensation' - if it is, you check out whether or not you have any reaction to it. It is literally just a flavour enhancer. Nothing else. If you want a proper 'burning sensation' sprinkle some cayenne pepper, or even chilli on your food.

As for the couple of euro price difference, I should have clarified. I live in an area where takeaways are expensive, and was surprised to see yours even more expensive in the midlands. I can see how you thought I was belittling the expense in your area, but I was doing the opposite.  I was shocked by the price, as I am in my own area, which I already know to be expensive. So both are pricey, yours are just pricey AF.

Somehow the places here use absolutely crap bread that tastes like cardboard, somehow really greasy meat, exceptionally poor quality salads that don't taste fresh at all, and the sauces aren't great either. 

If you took our high quality ingredients and combined them with the skill and attention to detail of the Turkish-German kebab shops, you would have a genuinely premium product that I'd happily spend a tenner on (that's about 3x what I would pay in Germany usually - 3 to 4 euros for a döner with everything).

The quality of the lamb (or chicken, or veal) matters, as does how well/properly the meat is marinated/spiced before putting on a skewer. 

Then there's some care needed with regards the temperature, so the fats render out (removing greasiness) but also the meat doesn't become dry shite.

The salads and sauces: can be either good or shit, tbh. Salads either fresh, or it can fuck off. 

The bread: underappreciated aspect of a good kebab. You know when you have a kebab with good bread. You also know when you have one with shit bread.

Sometimes you have to be careful how you order something like that. Many places have a deal, often only listed as a meal under ""sweet & sour chicken balls"" in the main menu area, i.e. it comes with chips. In all takeaways whenever I asked to change the sauce they would.  


If you do not get it as a deal they might charge full individual prices. E.g. in mine if you rattle it off ""can I get chicken balls, curry sauce and chips, and a spice bag with that"" if somebody said ""can I get a portion of chicken balls, and chips, a spice bag, oh and a curry sauce"" It is 2.70 more, unless the cashier is sound, the portion sizes are identical. In some places it may be automated menus doing the count.  


It used to work out at just 10 or 20cent to get curry sauce, nowadays its crazier, it is 8.70 for chicken balls and chips, but if you get the curry sauce too it is 8.50!  


A mate of mine refused to believe this, he rang an order to a different place as ""3 portions of chicken balls, (the person must have said anything else?), 3 portions of chips, (pause again) and 3 curry sauces. He was told a very high price, I told him this is likely due to the wording. He rang back and asked to cancel the order, and then ordered again and was told a far cheaper price.",t3_yjko7f

1. Dowload the Dunnes app and using a temporary email address sign up. Note do not use your phone number for the verification process, you need to get the code from the inbox of your temporary email address
2. Enter the code and complete sign up. New customers of the app get a 10 euro off 30 euro voucher within about 20 minutes of signing up
3. Repeat this process as much as you can till the idiots in head office one day cop it and close off the loophole that allows customers of Dunnes to get 33% off. Ensure you only spend slightly over 30 euro each time so you are getting the max potential discount. This way you are getting 30 euros worth of food for 20 euro. Match that with their meat sales when they have 25% off and you are saving a nice wad of money. 

Other than that it sounds like you are doing everything you can. In general when it comes to trying to reduce costs look at things like your car insurance or other larger bills like phone, broadband, tv. There is always a way to reduce them and it will save you a lot more money than cutting back on food would.

Taking into consideration the cost for electricity, 2kg flour, seeds and nuts and yeast, I get away with about €3 for a loaf of bread that lasts a week, no mold like some of the store-bought breads.

Offers go into the freezer, leftover go into the freezer. If I get an offer on flour, I make pizza dough and stock the freezer. Very little fresh fruit bar bananas and apples or anything on offer.

Buy a rice cooker and get big bag of rice from the asian market, 1 cup = 1 meal if you get some sauce and some veg with some meat. So for 1 person 2 days of food 3 meals a day is 6 cups of rice and you can cook it all at once with most decent rice makers. In terms of rice makers don't get any of the western ones, the Asian ones are the best, Cuckoo is the brand, they cost about 80 euro and are super simple to use. Just put in rice (wash the rice a few times) with about half a fingertip of water above your rice and press the button on the front. Easy peasy.

Cook in bulk too, I get a few days out of a meal prepped in the slow cooker, just pop remaining stews or currys into a container and once cooled you can store in the fridge for 2-3 days. Also the slow cooker is the most energy efficient way to cook so get using one.",t3_tz1f3j

* pressure cooker - it's just cheaper and faster to cook with when you need to boil the spuds or veg.

I'll do the same thing to the air fryer to try to keep the fight fair. My last leccy bill says I'm paying 21.12 cents per kWh, so that oven costs 63.36 cents to run per hour.

A quick peek at amazon, and I'm going to generalize an air fryer to 100 quid and 1500W.  Because I'm lazy and it's going to make my maths easier - comparing 1.5kW to 3kW is nice and easy, it costs half as much per hour to run.  So 31.68 cents per hour.

So in a straight race - saving 31.68 cents per hour, it'd take 315.65 hours to pay for itself. At 1 hour a day it'd pay for itself in less than 11 months.

That doesn't account for it being faster.  I have no idea how much faster.  If it's twice as fast, then 1 hour of oven is 30 minutes of air fryer, so 63.36 cents of oven time is worth 15.68 cents of air fryer time, so you're down to 210 hours (of comparable oven time) to pay it back.  So 7 months if we stick to an hour a day.

(To make these realistic you'd need to figure out the duty cycle of each.  I mean my oven doesn't run full bore, it turns itself on and off to maintain the temperature.  So if you figure on it actually powering half the time and idling down half the time, 50% duty cycle would half the power cost / double the time to payback)",t3_tz1f3j

Electric (multi-cook) pressure cookers are fantastic, but have their pros and cons.

They're great for one-pot stuff (like a chicken stew) but, if you're making several things in different ways, you'll find yourself using the hobs and the oven instead or as well.

Like, I use mine several times a week, but still make bolognese the old-fashioned way.

But I always use it for potatoes, because it's handy.

You can fry stuff in it just fine, but it's really no handier than the hob.

That said, I *will* brown off the beef in it, if I'm making a beef stew, just to keep the browned juices in it.

And don't believe the stuff about ""a chicken stew in 10 minutes"".

It's more like ""a chicken stew after 5 minutes of prep, 10 minutes of pressure build-up, and then 10 minutes of cook time, and then possibly 10 minutes of natural pressure release"".

Which is still great, with zero need to look after it after you press start, but there's no need to omit that.

Whilst I can make my own bread, I don't have the time during the week to do it. It takes the better part of a day to make a loaf, as I do it all by hand - no fancy bread making machine. It also requires a certain amount of warmth to be available right when I need it, so this isn't a good time of year for that.

I'll probably make bread some weekends once warmer weather is guaranteed. 

The thing is, a bag of flour still costs about  €4 per kg.. and that only does 2 loaves. I'd have to buy a new bag every week, because it gets used for things like gravy during the week as well. 

I have a cheaper, pre-packaged bread I get, that's €1 per loaf (last I checked) which I keep in the freezer, but it's only good for toast, or small toasted sandwiches. And I don't always want toast, y'know.",t3_tz1f3j

Been living abroad for years. Went back to visit the family. mother asks what I'd like to eat on the way back from the airport.

partly because I wanted one,.partly because it was late and I didnt want her going to.trouble, i asked that we just stop at a petrol station, and I'll grab a hot chicken.roll. mother said no. fair enough she's the boss.

between this and that I didn't get a chance to buy one until a morning a week later : Dying (DYING) hungover, staying at my mates, I got up.early and got rolls for us all-plain for them, and mine with bacon, stuffing, cheese, mayo and sweet chili.

Will I open it and have a bit on the way home?
no no, let's wait and savor it properly.

Got back to the house, opened it up.... no chicken.
NO. CHICKEN.

The chicken fillet roll ordering process is one of the most intimidating and nerve-wracking processes of the Irish experience.

Anyway, back to just before Christmas this year. The missus is helping her mammy out with her florist business and I have a couple of days to myself so I take the dog out to Ballybunion and, feeling brave, thought I'd conquer my fears and order a CFR at the Centra in Clarina (don't get me started about the queuing for fuel).

So, mask on, I head up to the counter and ask for a ""Chicken fillet roll please"", when quizzed what I want on it (mild panic setting in), I opt for lettuce and mayo which seems to be accepted (phew). She then asks again what I want on it...my worst fears are realised, alarm bells going off. What does she mean? A single bead of sweat trickles down the crack of my arse. ""S-sorry?"" I stutter, fight or flight is setting in, I'd make a run for it but I haven't paid for my petrol yet. ""You just want a roll and lettuce?!"" she barks.

Irish beef and dairy is widely considered among, if not the, best in the world. It's not some mass produced cheap stuff that gets shipped all over the world because its cheap to produce, its exactly the opposite, its generally free range, grass fed and often organic. Beef farms here are generally small scale, family owned and not industrial.

Definitely something funky going on in your supermarket.

As for pork and chicken, I don't believe we have the same reputation for quality but we do have pretty good regulations on the animal welfare as far as I am aware. Chicken more than anything might be occasionally imported but many people would specially look for free range Irish chicken.",t3_nxg988

Also, their beef is gross. It's pink. Like no ageing to it. It makes sense, since their animals are mostly indoors. 

Our beef is of an incredible quality and incredibly cheap price. A testament to which is how funny would it look to see grass fed as a distinguisher here? Like, pretty much all our cows eat is grass. Meanwhile, in most of the rest of the world, grass fed is a symbol of distinct quality. It's funny, except for all the suffering and stuff. Like, I get the whole vegetarian side to it all, but just from a quality of life aspect, Irish cows have it made. Our island is a shade of green most cattle in the world will never ever see the likes of. Like, bar some French or Swiss herds in particular regions, there's not a country in the world with such a nice  level of fresh grass to herd ratio.",t3_nxg988

But boy do we eat meat. According to a newspaper article from two years ago we eat about 85kg of meat per person and year, apparently far above EU average. 29% of that being beef. To my knowledge the majority try to buy domestic wherever possible, most doing it out of principle.

All that being said, about half of all meat consumed here is imported. Don't know if it's because of consumer prices, low supply, or simply that some products people buy are only produced with imported meats.

At a decent but not fancy sit-down restaurant here, you'd probably expect to pay €5-10 for a starter and for a dessert, and €10-20 for a main course. Something a bit more expensive like a steak might run you €20-€30. €4-6 or so for a pint, ~€6-8 for a glass of house wine, €10 for a mixed drink wouldn't be atypical for a restaurant.

355,fwuivc4,t1_fwu0pie,"It's a bit complicated in the US, because there's no nationwide sales tax. Here, the VAT amount is the same everywhere for any given class of product or service, and it doesn't change very often. In the US, sales tax (the equivalent of VAT for the end consumer) is largely determined at the state level, but counties and even cities can add their own sales taxes as well, so the same item might be taxed at, say, 5% statewide, but 6% in one particular county in the state, and 7% in one particular city in that county. Those rates can also change relatively frequently; tacking on a small (usually ~1%) sales tax from time to time is a common way for municipalities or counties to quickly add some funding to their budget for a particular year.
